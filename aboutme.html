<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there, thanks for stopping by my about me page. </p>
<p> I am currently a senior at the University of Colorado Boulder, studying Information Science with minros in Space and Computer Science. 
    I am the current President for Women of Aeronautics and Astronautics, which is an engineering student organization at CU aimed towards empowering women and non-biary students to succeed in the aerospace industry. 
    As president I am proud of the community I have that grows and networks with other companies around the Boulder area. 
    I am hoping to graduate in the Fall of 2021, and am looking for internships in the DC area for the summer of 2021. 
</p>
