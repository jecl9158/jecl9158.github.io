<h1> Information Science Portfolio.</h1>
<p>My Most recent project was to analyze the City of boulder accounts payable and to cross reference with the Census population estimation. 
</p>
<p> In the Fall of 2020 I participated in the NASA L'Space Mission Concept Academy. In a team of 10 students we collaborated on a Project Design Review to design a rover, science objectives, and budget for a misison to Encelauds. 
    Enceladus is an icy moon orbiting Saturn, which is believed to have an ocean underneath its icy crust. Our mission was to explore the south pole of this moon, to determine the makeup of the core.
