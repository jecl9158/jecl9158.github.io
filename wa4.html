    <p> While I am a fan of Rick and Morty the TV show, and I know is satire comdey, the representation of women is low. How do I know this? 
        I watched the show, and also used the rick and morty api to complie a data set of 60 characters and divide up their genders. 
        What I concluded from this is that, on average, there are more males in this show than females. 
        Statisticly speaking. There is a greater chance that any character in this show is a male. 
    </p>
    <p>The data set I used for this argument comes from git hub, on the <a href="https://rickandmortyapi.com/">Rick and Morty API.</a> 
    I looked at 60 characters and compiled their genders. Here are the totals that I came up with; 
    <li>Male: 43</li>
    <li>Female: 12</li>
    <li>Unknown: 5</li>
    Looking at theese number is pretty aparent that it is a male dominated TV show. So, let's graph these and visually see what is happening.

    From this image the numbers are especially clear. 
    </p>
    <p>So why are there so many male characters in this show? One article from <a herf="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/10/rick-and-morty-masculinity/568306/">The Atlantic</a>
    suggests that is is the damaged American male. The humor is based around "ingrown bor-ness" and "a cackling in the man cave". Noted in this article; 
    <blockquote cite = "https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/10/rick-and-morty-masculinity/568306/" >
        â€œThe female wirters who were hired for the show's thierd season were infamously harassed and abused by [sinckering, alienated-white-male troll behavior]." 
    </blockquote>
    The writer is talking about the fan base of the show. The co-creater Harmon did like that this was happening.
