<h1> Weekly Assignment 2 </h1>
<h2>Game Stop and the Short Squeze</h2>
<h3>February 5th 2021</h3>
<p>
    As an information scientist, I found it very interesting to hear of multiple online communities
 that could come together and control a portion of the stock market. Through collaborating on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/">Wall Street Bets</a>, 
 a subreddit page, people collaboratively decided to save a dying stock. Some might say that this should be illegal, 
 those people are the Hedge fund managers that lost billions. Robbin Hood, a popular stock market app for everyday people, 
 immediately shut down selling stocks for Game Stop once it started. The Hedgefund managers might agree that was a good move, 
 but the people on<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/">Wall Street Bets</a> could not be stopped. Having a movement on an online platform is beneficial because you 
 can then get people interested from not just amature stockbrokers, but other areas of interest and regions as well. When the US 
 started limiting Game Stop stock, people from Canada started to buy-in. While Reddit is used by many different generations, 
 those who instigated this plan were around millennial age. With online platforms, such as Tik Tok, older gen Z-ers started 
 to buy in as well. Without an online platform, this short squeeze at this magnitude would have been impossible to pull off. 
</p> 
<p>
    What is so interesting about the media covering this, is that they are calling the people on Wall Street Bets “hyper-online mischief-makers”, 
    says the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/28/technology/gamestop-stock.html">NY Times</a>. If these people are mischief-makers, 
    why are so many people in on the game? People who are investing their stock into GameStop understand that this isn’t a long-term investment. 
    This is about a community coming together through Reddit, to “stick it to the man”. In an effort to label what this was,
    <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/28/technology/gamestop-stock.html">NY Times</a> calls it a “revenge of the nerds”. 
    This label has me doubtful about what other platforms have to say.
</p>
<p>
    One platform that has boomed during the pandemic that not many older millennials use is Tik Tok. Through personal 
    experience on this app, I have to say it has opened me up to so many different voices and ways of thinking. 
    With this app comes many more voices explaining what was happening with the <a href=" https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMee6Xfh8/">short squeeze</a> 
    and <a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMee6otgr/ ">when to sell or when to hold</a>. Through Tik Tok this brings younger 
    millennials and older gen Z-ers who have the money and independence to make these risky moves as well.
     Not only does it bring them into the picture, but it also educates them, and it may get many older gen Z-ers interested in stocks. 
</p>
<p>
    The more people that buy Game stop and the many other stocks that Wall Street Bets is trying to short squeeze,
    the bigger the short squeeze on these hedge fund managers will be. As pointed out in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/28/technology/gamestop-stock.html">NY Times</a> article
    <blockquote cite = "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/28/technology/gamestop-stock.html" >
        “these internet-based insurgencies tend to follow a similar pattern. One day, 
        a group decides to take action against a system it feels is immoral or corrupt.”
    </blockquote>
    Seen over and over again in the past few years, online communities and people who are able to quickly navigate them is something that the rich should be wary of. 
    This Game Stop short squeeze is not just about the hedge fund managers but all of the 1%, and how the internet is a powerful tool for resistance.
