<h1> Weekly Assignment 2 </h1>
<h2>Game Stop and the Short Squeze</h2>
<p> As an information scientist, I found it very intersted to hear of an online community 
    that could come together and controll a portion of the stock  market. Through collaborating 
    on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/">Wall Street Bets</a>, a subreddit page, people collaboratively 
    decided to save a dying stock. Some might say that this should be illegal, those people are
    the Hedge fund managers that lost billions. Robbin Hood, a popular stock market app for everyday peope, 
    immediatly shut down selling stocks for Game Stop ones it started. The Hedgefund managers might agree what was 
    a good move, but the people on Wall Street Bets could not be stopped. Having a movement on an online
    platfrom is beneficial because you can then get people interseted from not just this area, but other areas as well. 
    When the US started limiting Game Stop stock, people from Canada started to buy in. With out an online platorm, this short squeeze would 
    have been impossible to pull off.

The Hedgefund managers might agree that was a good move, but the people on Wall Street Bets could not be stopped. Having a movement on an online platform is beneficial because you can then get people interested from not just amature stockbrokers, but other areas of interest and region as well. When the US started limiting Game Stop stock, people from Canada started to buy-in. While Reddit is used by many different generations, those who instigated this plan were the millennials. With online platforms, and with how rumors spread, older gen Z-ers started to buy in as well. Without an online platform, this short squeeze would have been impossible to pull off.
